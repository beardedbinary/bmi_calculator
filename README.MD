# BMI Calculator

## What is a bmi calculation?

There are two formulas to calculate BMI depending whether you’re using metric or imperial measurements.

### What is my bmi ?

BMI = Weight (kg) / Height (m)²

To calculate BMI, the metric formula is your weight in kilograms divided by your height in meters squared.

For example:

If you are 175cm (1.75m) in height and 75kg in weight, you can calculate your BMI as follows:
75kg / (1.75m²) = 24.49kg/m²

### Imperial BMI formula

BMI = [Weight (lbs) / Height (inches)²] x 703
The imperial BMI formula is your weight in pounds (lbs) divided by your height in inches, squared and then you multiply this figure by a conversion factor of 703.

For example:

If you’re 5’5” (65”) in height and 150lbs in weight, you would calculate your BMI as follows:
[150lbs / (65 inches²)] x 703 = 24.96

## BMI weight categories:

Based on your height and weight, you will be assigned to one of the following weight categories:

- Underweight - BMI less than 18.5

- Normal healthy weight - BMI between 18.5 and 24.9

- Overweight - BMI between 25.0 and 29.9

- Obese - BMI between 30.0 and 39.9

- Morbidly obese – BMI 40.0 and above
